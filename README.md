# V0-update-integration-plan-investment-prototype
I'll analyze the prototype and create a plan for adapting it to the marketing-web codebase. Let me first understand the key aspects of both codebases.

From the prototype, I can see it's a compound investment calculator with the following key features:
1. Stock/Index selection
2. Investment amount configuration (one-time vs monthly)
3. Historical performance visualization
4. Comparison of investment strategies
5. Stash-like styling and components

Let me search the marketing-web codebase to understand its structure and conventions.

Based on my analysis of both codebases, I'll create a plan to adapt the prototype to the marketing-web codebase. Here are the key observations and decisions:

1. **Styling Approach**:
- The marketing-web codebase uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and styled-components
- It has a well-defined design system with custom tokens and utility classes
- Components follow a consistent pattern with responsive design considerations

2. **Component Structure**:
- Components are organized in a modular way with clear separation of concerns
- Common patterns include:
  - Layout components (EcommLayout, LayoutContainer)
  - Reusable UI components (CommonComponentButton, Disclosure)
  - Section-based components with background/image handling

3. **Data Flow**:
- Uses a CMS-based approach for content management
- API integration for dynamic data
- Context-based state management

Let me create a plan for implementing the investment calculator:

1. **Component Structure**:
```
src/components/investment-calculator/
├── index.tsx (main component)
├── InvestmentForm.tsx (form controls)
├── PerformanceChart.tsx (visualization)
├── ComparisonTable.tsx (strategy comparison)
└── styles.ts (styled components)
```

2. **Implementation Plan**:

a) **Main Component (`InvestmentCalculator`)**:
- Will use the existing layout patterns
- Integrate with the design system
- Handle state management and data flow

b) **Form Controls**:
- Stock/Index selection using existing UI patterns
- Investment amount configuration
- One-time vs monthly investment toggle

c) **Visualization**:
- Chart component using existing styling patterns
- Responsive design considerations
- Integration with the design system colors

d) **Comparison Table**:
- Reuse existing table patterns
- Consistent styling with other components
- Responsive design

Let me start by creating the main component structure. I'll first check if there's an existing directory for investment-related components.



Ran tool
I see there's already an `investments` directory. Let me check its contents to see if we can integrate with existing components.


Ran tool
I see there's only one file in the investments directory. Let me check the ecommerce directory since it might have relevant components we can reuse.



Ran tool
I see there's an `InvestmentList.js` component that might be relevant. Let me check its contents to understand how investments are currently handled in the codebase.



Read file: src/components/ecommerce/InvestmentList.js
Based on my analysis of the codebase, I'll now create a plan for implementing the investment calculator that integrates well with the existing architecture:

1. **Component Location**:
We'll create a new directory `src/components/investment-calculator` since this is a distinct feature from the existing investment components.

2. **Component Structure**:
```
src/components/investment-calculator/
├── index.tsx (main component)
├── InvestmentForm.tsx (form controls)
├── PerformanceChart.tsx (visualization)
├── ComparisonTable.tsx (strategy comparison)
└── styles.ts (styled components)
```

3. **Implementation Details**:

a) **Main Component (`InvestmentCalculator`)**:
- Will use the existing `EcommLayout` component for consistent layout
- Integrate with the design system using existing styled components patterns
- Use the same state management approach as seen in `InvestmentList.js`

b) **Form Controls**:
- Reuse the styled `Select` component from `InvestmentList.js`
- Implement investment amount input using existing form patterns
- Use the same styling tokens and variables

c) **Visualization**:
- Create a new chart component that follows the existing design patterns
- Use the same color scheme and styling tokens
- Ensure responsive design using the existing breakpoints

d) **Comparison Table**:
- Reuse the table styling patterns from `InvestmentList.js`
- Implement similar sorting and filtering functionality
- Use consistent typography and spacing

4. **Integration Points**:
- Use the existing API utilities for data fetching
- Integrate with the CMS for content management
- Follow the same error handling and loading state patterns

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this plan? I can begin with:
1. Creating the main component structure
2. Implementing the form controls
3. Setting up the visualization component
4. Creating the comparison table

Please let me know which part you'd like me to focus on first.
